building a holistic MIND + BODY system where the menstrual cycle becomes a tool for understanding energy patterns, not a  
 mystery.

- three-journal structure (DAILY/CYCLE/CREATE)
- everything flows from mobile capture to web exploration.

Current Foundation:

- Voice capture with transcription working
- Rich text documents with thinking partner AI
- Basic cycle tracking (cycle_day, cycle_phase calculation)
- Media upload with EXIF date detection
- Database: captures, documents, conversations, messages, daily_logs, media_items, cycle_periods

What We're Building:

- Mobile: Redesign to Plan/Track (toggle) / Capture / Community tabs with timer tracking
- Web: Add CYCLE journal with calendar views (daily/weekly/monthly/circular)
- New capabilities: Voice-to-task parsing, timer sessions, cycle agents, Oura integration
