## FOUNDATION: Core Infrastructure

- [x] Database schema supports cycle tracking (captures, timer_sessions, daily_tasks, cycle_periods)
- [x] User authentication working (web + mobile)
- [x] File storage configured (voice, photos, videos)
- [x] Mobile app can connect to backend

---

## CAPTURE: Voice, Photo, Video

- [x] Can record voice notes on mobile
- [x] Can take photos on mobile
- [x] Can record videos on mobile
- [x] Can upload historical media (photos/videos from device library)
- [x] All captures tagged with timestamp
- [x] Voice notes transcribed automatically

---

## CYCLE TRACKING: Foundation

- [x] Can log menstrual period (start/end dates)
- [x] System calculates cycle day automatically
- [x] System determines cycle phase (menstrual, follicular, ovulation, luteal)
- [x] All captures auto-tagged with cycle day + phase
- [x] Cycle indicator visible in mobile app

---

## PLANNING: Daily Intention & Tasks

- [x] Can record morning intention via voice
- [x] Can plan daily to do with to do task list
- [x] Tasks appear in mobile interface for tracking

---

## TRACKING: Timers & Activities

- [x] Can start timer from task
- [x] Timer runs and displays elapsed time
- [x] Can stop timer (creates activity record)
- [x] Multiple concurrent timers supported
- [x] Captures during active timer linked to that activity
- [ ] Activity records include actual start/end times

---

## REFLECTION: Evening & Daily

- [x] Can record evening reflection via voice
- [x] Reflection trigger appears in tracking interface
- [x] Full day visible: intention � activities � captures � reflection

---

## WEB DAILY: Awareness Journal

- [x] Web shows all captures in chronological feed
- [x] Voice transcriptions visible with playback
- [x] Photos/videos display inline
- [x] Activity blocks show in timeline
- [x] Can filter by note type (intention, daily, reflection)
- [x] Can search across transcriptions
- [x] Cycle phase context visible for each day

---

## WEB CYCLE: Calendar Visualization

- [x] Weekly view: 7-day grid showing activities and captures
- [x] Monthly view: calendar grid with cycle phase colors
- [x] Cycle view: circular 28-day wheel showing full cycle
- [x] Can click day � zoom to detailed daily view
- [x] Can navigate between dates/weeks/months/cycles

---

## PATTERN RECOGNITION: Cycle Lens

- [x] Voice notes positioned at capture time
- [x] Can see when most captures occur across cycle
- [x] Cycle phase colors consistent throughout system

---

## AI THINKING PARTNER: Deep Exploration

- [x] Can create rich text documents from captures
- [x] Document editor supports long-form writing
- [x] AI thinking partner chat per document
- [x] Conversation history persists
- [x] Can expand fleeting thoughts into developed ideas

---

## AI CYCLE AGENTS: Contextual Guidance

- [ ] Cycle agents sidebar in calendar
- [ ] Group conversation: Nutrition + Movement + Mindset + Orchestrator
- [ ] Agents aware of current cycle day/phase
- [ ] Agents have access to recent captures
- [ ] Agents have access to activity patterns
- [ ] Agents provide cycle-aligned guidance

---

## BIOMETRIC INTEGRATION: Oura Ring

- [ ] Oura OAuth authentication working
- [ ] Can sync daily Oura data (HRV, sleep, readiness, activity)
- [ ] Oura data displays in calendar views
- [ ] Cycle agents have access to Oura data
- [ ] Can see biometric patterns across cycle phases

---

## POLISH & INSIGHTS: User Experience

- [ ] Mobile UI intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Web UI clean and delightful
- [ ] Cycle phase colors beautiful and consistent
- [ ] No critical bugs in daily use
- [ ] Can use system daily for full cycle (28 days)
- [ ] System reveals patterns that weren't obvious before
- [ ] User feels in control of health and energy

---

## ULTIMATE SUCCESS:

**User understands how their cycle influences their mind, body, and energy**
**User plans with their biology, not against it**
**Cycle is a tool, not a mystery**

---

## OUT OF SCOPE (Future Enhancements):

- Daily AI summaries (end-of-day synthesis)
- Cycle audits (review at cycle end)
- Cycle intentions (goal-setting per cycle)
- Projects & knowledge graph (Neo4j)
- Export functionality
- Multi-device real-time sync
- Community features (sharing, insights, connection)
- Cycle prediction ML
