# üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Phase 1

**Current Status:** You're 80% there! Processing pipeline works, just need Neo4j population and agent integration.

---

## Immediate Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Get Docker Running ‚úÖ
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify Neo4j is running:
- Open http://localhost:7474
- Login: `neo4j` / `builderki123`
- Should see the Neo4j Browser interface

---

### 2. Install Python Dependencies üì¶
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Run Neo4j Population Script üîÑ

**Test connections first:**
```bash
python scripts/populate_neo4j.py --test
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Supabase connection: OK
‚úÖ Neo4j connection: OK
```

**Backfill all existing captures:**
```bash
python scripts/populate_neo4j.py --backfill
```

This will:
- Find all completed captures in Supabase
- Read their insights
- Create nodes in Neo4j
- Create relationships

**Expected output:**
```
üîÑ Starting backfill of all captures...
üì¶ Found X completed captures to process

[1/X] Processing capture from 2025-01-15...
üìä Processing capture abc12345... (5 insights)
‚úÖ Successfully processed capture abc12345

...

‚úÖ Backfill complete!
   Successful: X
   Failed: 0
   Total: X
```

---

### 4. Verify Neo4j is Populated ‚ú®

**In Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474), run:**

```cypher
// See all captures
MATCH (c:Capture) RETURN c LIMIT 10
```

You should see your captures as nodes!

```cypher
// See insights connected to captures
MATCH (c:Capture)-[:EXTRACTED_FROM]->(i:Insight)
RETURN c, i LIMIT 10
```

You should see a graph visualization!

```cypher
// Count everything
MATCH (c:Capture) RETURN count(c) as captures
MATCH (i:Insight) RETURN count(i) as insights
MATCH (d:Decision) RETURN count(d) as decisions
MATCH (q:Question) RETURN count(q) as questions
MATCH (concept:Concept) RETURN count(concept) as concepts
```

---

### 5. Test Agent with Dummy Data (Optional)

Before building full agent integration, test that queries work:

```cypher
// Find captures mentioning a keyword
MATCH (c:Capture)-[:MENTIONS]->(concept:Concept)
WHERE concept.name CONTAINS "authentication"
RETURN c.transcription, c.created_at
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC
```

Try different keywords from your captures to see if it finds them!

## What Comes Next (After Neo4j Works)

Once Neo4j is populated, the critical path items are:

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Add Emotion Detection to Claude Prompt**
   - Update the n8n "Convert to JSON" node
   - Add emotion extraction to the prompt
   - Test with a capture that has emotional content

2. **Build Agent Neo4j Query Functions**
   - Create utility functions to query Neo4j from Next.js
   - Test queries in isolation first
   - Functions needed:
     - `searchCapturesByKeyword(keyword)`
     - `getRelatedConcepts(captureId)`
     - `getRecentCaptures(userId, limit)`

3. **Integrate Queries into Thinking Partner**
   - Update `/api/thinking-partner` route
   - Give agent access to Neo4j queries
   - Update system prompt to know it can query the corpus
   - Test: "What have I been thinking about [X]?"

4. **Enhance Pensieve Display**
   - Show extracted insights on each capture card
   - Make insights expandable/collapsible
   - Add emotion indicators if emotions detected

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

5. **Polish Mobile UX**
   - Better success/error feedback
   - Processing status indicator
   - Offline handling

6. **Dogfood for 2 Weeks**
   - Use it daily
   - Capture thoughts regularly
   - Query agent with real questions
   - Note what works and what doesn't

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Phase 2)

- Projects UI
- Advanced search
- Analytics
- Export functionality

## Quick Reference Commands

**Start everything:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
cd web && pnpm dev
# In another terminal: cd mobile && npm start
```

**Populate Neo4j:**
```bash
python scripts/populate_neo4j.py --backfill
```

**Watch for new captures (daemon mode):**
```bash
python scripts/populate_neo4j.py --watch
```

**Check Neo4j:**
- Browser: http://localhost:7474
- Credentials: neo4j / builderki123

**Check n8n:**
- Browser: http://localhost:5678

---

## Troubleshooting

**Neo4j won't start?**
```bash
docker-compose logs neo4j
docker-compose restart neo4j
```

**Script can't connect?**
- Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
- Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Verify Neo4j port 7687 is open: `netstat -an | grep 7687`

**No captures to process?**
- Capture a voice note on mobile first
- Wait 30-60 seconds for n8n to process
- Check Supabase: captures table should show status='complete'
- If stuck in 'pending', check n8n logs

---

## Success Criteria

You'll know Phase 1 is complete when:

‚úÖ You can capture voice on mobile
‚úÖ Transcription appears on web within 60 seconds
‚úÖ Insights are visible in Pensieve
‚úÖ Neo4j graph is populated
‚úÖ Agent can answer "What have I been thinking about X?"
‚úÖ You've dogfooded for 2+ weeks and it feels valuable
